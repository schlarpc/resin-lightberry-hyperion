This is a resin.io application for controlling the ambient lighting on my TV.

It also has a built-in Alexa Smart Home Skill, although a simple Lambda proxy is needed to use it.
This is included in lambda_proxy.py and should be configured as a Python 3.6 with the DEVICE_UUID
environment variable set to the Resin device ID.
